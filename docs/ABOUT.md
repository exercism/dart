[Dart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(programming_language)) is a general-purpose computer programming language that is:
 1. [Concurrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing)
 2. [Class-Based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-based_programming)
 3. [Object-Oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)

Dart applications are typically compiled to [bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode) that can run on any [Dart virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_virtual_machine) (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.

The primary concepts baked into the making of the language were:

 - It is simple, object-oriented, and familiar.
 - It provides tools out of the box to help development efforts.
 - It is architecture-neutral and portable.
 - It executes with high performance for practical applications and not just benchmarks.

The language derives its syntax from Java and JavaScript; as well as Smalltalk.

## Why Learn Dart?

- DART IS FROM GOOGLE.
It is the programming language between many of their produces like AdSense.
It has grown to provide solutions for web-based content, and mobile apps

- [Write once, run anywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere) policy: Programs written in Dart are compiled into machine-independent bytecodes (or JavaScript for web apps), so it can run on any Dart platform.
Basically, Dart is [Platform Independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform#Platform-independent_software)

- Dart has a solid API:
Dart has built-in [application programming interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) (APIs) for I/O, networking, data structures, concurrency, and many other functions.
Standard libraries can be supplemented by open source libraries found on [Pub](https://pub.dartlang.org).

- Standardization:
If you need to write a web/enterprise app, or you need data persistence or you need to do cryptography, no problem!
Dart is all you require.
There are many standard tools/practices that extend the [Dart specification](https://www.dartlang.org/guides/language/spec) , thanks to the [Dart Enhancement Proposals](https://github.com/dart-lang/dart_enhancement_proposals) (DEP)!
