Dart brings object-oriented and typing together with the flexibility that JavaScript is known for.  It is designed to simplify common programming tasks. This has made the biggest impact in regards to web development via AngularDart which has the Angular framework implemented using Dart.

To dig deeper into Dart, [click here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(programming_language)).

The primary concepts baked into the making of the language were:

 - It is simple, object-oriented, and familiar.
   * The language derives its syntax from Java and JavaScript; as well as Smalltalk.
 - It provides tools out of the box to help development efforts.
 - It has strong support via many standard libraries.
 - It is architecture-neutral and portable.
 - It executes with high performance for practical applications and not just benchmarks.

Standardization:

If you need to write a web/enterprise app, or you need data persistence or you need to do cryptography, no problem!
Dart is all you require!

There is a rich ecosystem springing up around Dart because the standard (built-in) libraries can be supplemented by open source libraries found on [Pub](https://pub.dartlang.org).

And the community has a voice in the development of the language since there are many standard tools/practices that extend the [Dart specification](https://www.dartlang.org/guides/language/spec), thanks to the [Dart Enhancement Proposals](https://github.com/dart-lang/dart_enhancement_proposals) (DEP)!
