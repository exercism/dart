[Dart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(programming_language)) brings object-oriented and typing together with the flexibility that JavaScript is known for. This has made the biggest impact in regards to web develop via AngularDart which has the Angular framework implemented using Dart.

Dart applications are typically compiled to run in the Dart virtual machine (Dart VM) regardless of computer architecture.

The primary concepts baked into the making of the language were:

 - It is simple, object-oriented, and familiar.
 - It provides tools out of the box to help development efforts.
 - It is architecture-neutral and portable.
 - It executes with high performance for practical applications and not just benchmarks.

The language derives its syntax from Java and JavaScript; as well as Smalltalk.

## Why Learn Dart?

- DART IS FROM GOOGLE.
It is the programming language between many of their produces like AdSense.
It has grown to provide solutions for web-based content, and mobile apps

- [Write once, run anywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere) policy: Programs written in Dart are compiled into machine-independent bytecodes (or JavaScript for web apps), so it can run on any Dart platform.
Basically, Dart is [Platform Independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform#Platform-independent_software)

- Dart has a solid API:
Dart has built-in [application programming interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) (APIs) for I/O, networking, data structures, concurrency, and many other functions.
Standard libraries can be supplemented by open source libraries found on [Pub](https://pub.dartlang.org).

- Standardization:
If you need to write a web/enterprise app, or you need data persistence or you need to do cryptography, no problem!
Dart is all you require.
There are many standard tools/practices that extend the [Dart specification](https://www.dartlang.org/guides/language/spec) , thanks to the [Dart Enhancement Proposals](https://github.com/dart-lang/dart_enhancement_proposals) (DEP)!
