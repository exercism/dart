# Running the Tests

Choose your operating system:

* [Windows](#windows)
* [Mac OS X](#mac-os-x)
* [Linux](#linux)

# Windows

1. Open a Command Prompt.

1. Get the first exercise:

     ```batchfile
     C:\Users\JaneDoe>exercism fetch dart

     Not Submitted:     1 problem
     dart (Hello World) C:\Users\JaneDoe\exercism\dart\hello-world

     New:               1 problem
     dart (Hello World) C:\Users\JaneDoe\exercism\dart\hello-world

     unchanged: 0, updated: 0, new: 1
     ```

1. Change directory into the exercism:

     ```batchfile
     C:\Users\JaneDoe>cd C:\Users\JaneDoe\exercism\dart\hello-world
     ```

1. Download the dependent packages:

     ```batchfile
     C:\Users\JaneDoe>pub get
     ```

1. Run the tests:

     ```batchfile
     C:\Users\JaneDoe>pub run test
     ```
   *(Don't worry about the tests failing, at first, this is how you begin each exercise.)*

1. Solve the exercise.  Find and work through the `README.md` guide ([view on GitHub](https://github.com/exercism/dart/blob/master/exercises/hello-world/README.md)).


Good luck!  Have fun!
